# Housing_Market_Analysis___Data_Visualization_Project
## Project Description
This project contains four parts:
- What is the overall trend of the listed house price on Zillow?
- What is the healthiness score of the current housing market? Which place is best to invest?
- What is the housing affordability of each state/region? Is it more afforadable to live in rural region compared to downtown?

## Conclusions
1. Overall Housing Market Trend
  - There is a housing bubble during 2003 – 2006, when average price increased sharply.
  - The range of the price increased largely during housing bubble. Also, recently, same change happened. We could have a bold guess that next housing bubble would come in coming decades.
  - The house value increased faster in East region than in West region.

2. The Healthiness of Housing Market
  - CA is a great state with high health score and high sales, which is a good place to do house investing.
  - North Dakota has a healthy market before, but in recent years, it has an increasing number of listings and a decreasing sales, which is not a good sign for the house investor there.

3. Housing Affordability Trend
  - The housing affordability situation is getting worse. The growth rate of housing price is faster than its of income level in most of the states. Hawaii can be the next worst housing affordability state.
  - At region level, we surprisingly found affordability varies a lot with region and rural region is more likely to happen housing affordability crisis.
